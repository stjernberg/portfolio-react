            <p>
              I'm a Web developer with a background in education, looking for
              exiting opportunities! Working with digital tools has been a
              passion in my teaching. That has led med into the path of coding.
              I love the creativity and logic in coding and building websites.
              My goal is to build great user experiences, that are accessible
              and easy to understand.

              Currently I'm doing internship with focus on frontend and Angular,
              but also a bit of .Net. that's part of a web developmnet course at
              Lexicon, an education wwhere I learned to build applications in
              Asp.net with C#, Entity Framework and Identity. I also deepended
              my knowledge of React and Redux. Before that I attended Technigo
              Bootcamp - a 24-week fast-paced remote bootcamp focused on
              JavaScript, React, Redux HTML5, CSS and server-side programming
              with Node.js. There were weekly projects covering everything from
              the basics of programming to structuring web projects in the
              latest technologies. We worked with Agile methodology and
              mob-programming and pair-programming was a significant part of the
              education.
