            <p>
              I'm a Web developer with a background in education. Working with
              digital tools has been a passion in my teaching. That has led med
              into the path of coding. I love the creativity and logic in coding
              and building websites. My goal is to build great user experiences,
              that are accessible and easy to understand.
            </p>

              Currently I'm a student at Lexicon, with focus on building
              applications in Asp.net with c# Entity Framework and Razer View
              and React for the frontend. I've also attended Technigo Bootcamp -
              a 24-week fast-paced remote bootcamp focused on JavaScript (ES6),
              React, HTML5, CSS and server-side programming with Node.js. With
              weekly projects covering everything from the basics of programming
              to structuring web projects in the latest technologies. We worked
              with Agile methodology. Mob-programming and pair-programming was a
              significant part of the education.
